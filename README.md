# tiny role-playing game
Characters in the game can be one of three races: humans, elves, and dwarves. These are represented by the Human, Elf, and Dwarf structs, respectively. Characters interact with things. Things are represented by the Thing type.2 Thing is an enum that currently represents swords and trinkets. Thereâ€™s only one form of interaction right now: enchantment.
